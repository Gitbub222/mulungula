                Born and raised in the Democratic Republic of Congo, I grew
                up surrounded by its rich cultural heritage. At seven, I
                moved to South Africa, which gave me a fresh perspective on
                life and a love for new experiences. By fourteen, my family
                relocated again, this time to Louisville, Kentucky, where I
                thrived both academically and personally. I graduated from
                the University of Louisville in 2024 with a degree in computer
                science and engineering.
                My professional interests lie in web and mobile development,
                where I enjoy creating innovative solutions. But my
                curiosity doesn&apos;t stop there. I love diving into
                philosophical questions, trying to understand the world
                better. I also stay active with a rigorous workout routine
                and love experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. This
                mix of tech skills, intellectual curiosity, physical fitness,
                and culinary creativity is what defines me.
